# Butler Window for Unity
An Unity Editor Window for uploading builds to Itch.io

![itch io window](meta/itchiowindow.png)

This tool downloads & wraps [Butler](https://itch.io/docs/butler/) so you can build & upload your project to itch.io with a single button. It's ideal for rapidly sharing the latest iteration of your game, prototype or other without having to leave your Editor.

##Requirements
Butler Window was tested with Unity 2019.4 and 2020.2. Butler Window currently only builds to WebGL (by choice), so you need to have the WebGl Build module installed.

##Supported Platforms
Butler Window / Upload to itch.io currently only supports the UnityEditor on Windows, although it can be safely shared with Linux/macOS machines.

##Security
Butler Window uses Butler for authentication, so no passwords are stored by the package.
